# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
ðŸŽ“ I am Krzysztof Nowak, a student pursuing my Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence.<br>

ðŸ“š I began my programming journey in 2024 with Python, but Iâ€™ve also completed projects in C and Bash. My coursework was heavily focused on mathematics, so my strongest areas are calculus, linear algebra, probability, and related fields. <br>
